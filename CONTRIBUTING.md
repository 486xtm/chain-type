We welcome all contributions!

## Developing

First, run `pnpm i` to install all deps.

We use TypeScript monorepo, each target is a separate package and has another package with tests. You need to run
`pnpm watch` to automatically recompile all the projects as you introduce changes.

Run `pnpm test:fix` before pushing, it will run eslint, prettier in fix mode and run all tests.

### Local linking

Run `pnpm build` to build all packages or `pnpm watch` to start watching. Then enter desired package directory and run
`pmpm link`.
